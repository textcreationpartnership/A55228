1. A
COMMENTARY
ON THE
PROPHECY of the PROPHET
MICAH.

    _ CHAP. I.

      * VER. 1.The word of the Lord that
came to Micah the Morasthite, in
the daies of Iotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah,
kings of Iudah, which he
saw concerning Samaria and Ierusalem.

      * 2.Hear all ye People, hearken, O Earth,
and all that therein is, and let the
Lord God be witness against you,
the Lord from his Holy Temple.

      * 3.For behold, the Lord cometh forth
out of his place, and will come down,
and tread upon the high places of the
Earth.

      * 4.And the Mountains shall be molten
under him, and the valleys shall be
cleft: as wax before the fire, and as
the waters that are poured down a
steep place.

      * 5For the transgression of Iacob is all this,
and for the sins of the House of Israel.
What is the transgression of Iacob? Is
it not Samaria? and what are the high
places of Iudah? Are they not Ierusalem?

      * 6Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap
of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard;
and I will poure down the stones
thereof into the valley, and I will discover
the foundations thereof.

      * 7And all the graven Images thereof shall
be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof
shall be burnt with the fire, and all the
Idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she
gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and
they shall return to the hire of an Harlot.

      * 8Therefore I will wail and howl, I
will go stript and naked: I will make a
wailing like the Dragons, and mourning
as the Owles.

      * 9For her wound is incurable, for it is
come unto Iudah: he is come unto the
gate of my People, even to Ierusalem.

      * 10Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not
at all: in the house of Aphrah roul thy
self in the dust.

      * 11Pass ye away thou inhabitant of Saphir,
having thy shame naked; the inhabitant
of Zaanan came not forth in the
mourning of Beth-ezel, he shall receive
of you his standing.

      * 1212 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited
carefully for good, but evill came down
from the Lord unto the gate of Ierusalem.

      * 13O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind
the chariot to the swift beast: she is the
beginning of the sin to the Daughter of
Zion: for the transgressions of Israel
were found in thee.

      * 14Therefore shalt thou give presents to
Moresheth-Gath: the houses of Achzib
shall be a lie to the Kings of Israel.

      * 15Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O
inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall
come unto Adullam, the glory of Israel.

      * 16Make the bold, and poll thee for thy
delicate Children, enlarge thy baldness
as the Eagle, for they are gone into captivity
from thee.

    _ CHAP. II.

      * VER. 1.Wo to them that devise iniquity,
and work evill upon their beds:
when the morning is light, they practice
it, because it is in the power of
their hand.

      * 2And they covet fields, and take them
by violence; and houses, and take them
away: so they oppress a Man and his
house, even a Man and his heritage.

      * 3Therefore thus saith the Lord, behold,
against this family do I devise an evill,
from which ye shall not remove your
necks, neither shall ye go haughtily:
for this time is evill.

      * 4In that day shall one take up a parable against
you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,
and say, We be utterly spoiled:
he hath changed the portion of my
people: how hath he removed it from me?
turning away he hath divided our fields.

      * 5Therefore thou shalt have none that shall
cast a cord by lot in the Congregation of
the Lord.

      * 6Prophesie ye not, say they to them that
Prophesie: they shall not Prophesie to them,
that they shall not take shame.

      * 7O thou that are named the house of Iacob,
Is the Spirit of the Lord straitned?
are these his doings? do not my words do
good to him that walketh uprightly?

      * 8Even of late my People is risen up as an
Enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment,
from them that pass by securely,
as Men averse from warr.

      * 9The VVomen of my People have ye cast out
from their pleasant Houses, from their
Children have ye taken away my Glory for
ever.

      * 10Arise ye and depart, for this is not your
rest, because it is polluted, it shall destroy
you even with a sore destruction.

      * 11If a Man walking in the Spirit and falshood,
do ly, saying, I will Prophesie
unto thee of Wine and strong Drink, he
shall even be the Prophet of this People.

      * 12I I will surely assemble, O Iacob, all
of thee, I will surely gather the remnant
of Israel, I will put them together as
the Sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the
midst of their fold; they shall make
great noise by reason of the multitude
of Men.

    _ CHAP. III.

      * VER. 1.And I said, Hear, I pray you,
O heads of Iacob, and ye Princes of the
house of Israel: Is it not for you to know
Iudgment?

      * 4Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he
will not hear them: he will even hide his
face from them at that time, as they have
behaved themselves ill in their doings.

      * 5Thus saith the Lord concerning the Prophets
that make my People erre, tha• bite
with their teeth, and cry, Peace: and he
that putteth not into their mouths, they
even prepare War against him.

      * 6Therefore night shall be unto you, that
ye shall not have a vision, and it shall be
dark unto you, that ye shall not divine,
and the Sun shall go down over the Prophets,
and the day shall be dark over
them.

      * 8But truly I am full of power by the Spirit
of the Lord, and of judgment, and
of might, to declare unto Iacob his transgression,
and to Israel his sin.

      * 9Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the
house of Iacob, and Princes of the house
of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert
all equity.

      * 10They build up Zion with blood, and Ierusalem
with iniquity.

      * 11The heads thereof judge for reward,
and the Priests thereof teach for hire,
and the Prophets thereof divine for money:
yet will they lean upon the Lord,
and say, Is not the Lord among us? no
evill can come upon us.

      * 12Therefore shall Zion for your sake be
plowed as a field, and Ierusalem shall become
heaps, and the mountain of the
house, as the high places of the forrest.

    _ CHAP. IV.

      * VER. 1.But in the last daies it shall come
to pass, that the mountain of the house
of the Lord shall be established in the top
of the mountains, and it shall be exalted
above the Hills, and People shall flow
unto it.

      * 2And many nations shall come, and say,
Come, and let us go up to the mountain of
the Lord, and to the house of the God of
Iacob, and he will teach us of his waies,
and we will walk in his paths: for the
Law shall go forth of Zion, and the word
of the Lord from Ierusalem.

      * 3¶And he shall judge among many People,
and rebuke strong Nations afar off; and
they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning
hooks: Nation shall not lift up a sword
against Nation, neither shall they learn
Warr any more.

      * 4But they shall sit every Man under his
Vine, and under his fig-tree, and none
shall make them afraid: for the mouth
of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it.

      * 5For all People will walk every one in the
name of his god, and we will walk in the
Name of the Lord our God for ever and
ever.

      * 6In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble
her that halteth, and I will gather
her that is driven out, and her that
I have afflicted.

      * 7And I will make her that halted a
remnant, and her that was cast far off,
a strong nation: and the Lord shall
reign over them in Mount Zion,
from henceforth even for ever.

      * 8¶And thou, O tower of the flock, the
strong hold of the Daughter of Zion, unto
thee shall it come, even the first dominion,
the Kingdom shall come to the
Daughter of Ierusalem.

      * 9Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is
there no King in thee? Is thy Counsellour
perished? for pangs have taken thee,
as a Woman in travail.

      * 10Be in pain, and labour to bring forth,
O Daughter of Zion, like a Woman in
travail: for now shalt thou go forth out
of the City, and thou shalt dwell in the
field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon:
there shalt thou be delivered, there
the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand
of thine Enemies.

      * 11¶Now also many Nations are gathered
against thee, that say, Let her be
defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

      * 12But they know not the thoughts of the
Lord, neither understand they his Counsel:
for he shall gather them as the
sheaves into the floor.

    _ CHAP. V.

      * VER. 1.Now gather thy self in Troups;
O Daughter of Troups: he hath laid
siege against us: they shall smite the
Iudge of Israel with a rod upon the
cheek.

      * 2But thou Beth-leem Ephratah, though
thou be little among the thousands of Iudah,
yet out of thee shall he come forth
unto me, that is to be ruler in Israel:
whose goings forth have been from of
old, from everlasting.

      * 3Therefore will he give them up, untill
the time that she which travelleth hath
brought forth: then the remnant of his
Brethren shall return unto the Children
of Israel.

      * 4¶And he shall stand and feed in the
strength of the Lord, in the Majesty of
the Name of the Lord his God, and they
shall abide: for now shall he be great unto
the ends of the Earth.

      * 5And this Man shall be the peace, when
the Assyrian shall come into our land:
and when he shall tread in our palaces,
then shall we raise against him seven shepherds,
and eight principal Men.

      * 7And the remnant of Iacob shall be in the
midst of many People, as a dew from the
Lord, as the showers upon the grasse,
that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth
for the sons of men.

      * 9Thine hand shall be lift up upon thine adversaries,
and all thine Enemies shall
be cut off.

      * 10And it shall come to pass in that day,
saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy
Horses out of the midst of thee, and I
will destroy thy Chariots.

      * 14And I will pluck up thy groves out of
the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy
Cities.

      * 15And I will execute vengeance in anger,
and fury upon the Heathen, such as they
have not heard.

    _ CHAP. VI.

      * VER. 1.Hear ye now what the Lord saith,
Arise, contend thou before the mountains,
and let the hills hear thy voice.

      * 3O my people, what have I done unto thee,
and wherein have I wearied thee? testifie
against me.

      * 4For I brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the
house of servants, and I sent before thee
Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

      * 6• Wherewith shall I come before the
Lord, and bow my self before the high
God? shall I come before him with burnt
offerings, with calves ef a year old?

      * 8He hath shewed thee, O Man, what is
good; and what doth the Lord require
of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?

      * 9The Lords voice crieth unto the Ci•y,
and the man of Wisdom shall s•e thy
name: Hear ye the rod, and who hath
appointed it.

      * VERS. 10.Are there yet the treasures
of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
and the scant measure that is abominable?

      * 11Shall I count them pure with the wicked
balances, and with the bag of deceitfull
weights?

      * 12For the rich men thereof are full of
violence, and the inhabitants thereof
have spoken lies, and their tongue is
deceitfull in their mouth.

      * 13Therefore also will I make thee sick
in smiting thee, in making thee desolate,
because of thy sins.

      * 14Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied,
and the casting down shall be in the
midst of thee, and thou shalt take
hold, but shalt not deliver: and that
which thou deliverest, will I give up
to the sword.

      * 15Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not
reap: thou shalt tread the olives,
but thou shalt not anoint thee with
oyle; and sweet wine, but shalt not
drink wine.

      * 16• For the statutes of Omri are kept,
and all the works of the house of Ahab,
and ye walk in their counsels, that
I should make thee a desolation, and
the inhabitants thereof an •issing:
therefore ye shall bear the reproach of
my people.

    _ CHAP. VII.

      * VERS. 1.Wo is me, for I am as when
they have gathered the summer-fruits,
as the grape-gleanings of the vintage:
there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired
the first-ripe fruit.

      * 2The good man is perished out of the
earth; and there is none upright among
men: they all lie in wait for blood: they
hunt every man his brother with a net.

      * 3¶That they may do evil with both
hands earnestly, the Prince asketh, and
the Iudg asketh for a reward: and the
great man uttereth his mischievous
desire: so they wrap it up.

      * 4The best of them is as a brier: the most
upright is sharper then a thorn-hedg:
the day of thy watchmen, and thy visitation
cometh; now shall be their
perplexity.

      * 5¶Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not
confidence in a guide: keep the doors
of thy mouth from her that lieth in
thy bosom.

      * 6For the son dishonoreth the father, the
daughter riseth up against her mother,
the daughter in law against her mother
in law; a mans enemies are the men
of his own house.

      * 7Therefore I will look unto the Lord:
I will wait for the God of my salvation:
my God will hear me.

      * 8¶Rejoice not against me, O mine
enemy: when I fall, I shall arise;
when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall
be a light unto me.

      * 10Then she that is mine enemy shall see
it, and shame shall cover her which
said unto me, Where is the Lord thy
God? mine eies shall behold her: now
shall she be troden down as the mire
of the streets.

      * 11In the day that thy walls are to be
built, in that day shall the decree be
far removed.

      * 14¶Fe•d thy People with thy rod,
the flock of thine heritage, which dwell
solitarily in the wood, in the midst
of Carmel: let them f•ed in Bashan
and Gil•ad, as in the daies of
old.

      * 15According to the daies of thy coming
out of the Land of Egypt will I shew
unto him marvellous things.

      * 16¶The Nations shall see and be confounded
at all their might, they shall
lay their hand upon their mouth, their
ears shall be deaf.

      * 17They shall lick the dust like a Serpent,
they shall move out of their holes
like worms of the Earth: they shall
be afraid of the Lord our God, and
shall fear because of thee.

      * 18Who is a God like unto thee, that
pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the
transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
he retaineth not his anger
for ever, because he delighteth in
mercy.

      * 20Thou wilt perform the truth to Iacob,
and the mercy to Abraham, which
thou hast sworn unto our Fathers from
the daies of old.
